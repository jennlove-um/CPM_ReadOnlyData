# Read only config file generated automatically from BatchROSQL-CTQA.yml at 2018-09-18-16-52

# Configuration file for generating SQL to REMOVE/RESTORE permissions
# from specific sites / roles.  Copy and rename the template file
# version to specialize it for a specific CTools instance.

# The file format is yaml. Note that yaml is sensitive to
# indentation. Lines whose first non-whitespace character is a '#' are
# ignored.

# Sites to be make read-only are chosen by site type.  Specific sites
# to exempt from the read-only change can be listed below.  Specific
# sites to be restored need to have their site ids listed below.
# Important details on this is given later in the file.

#########

# This is the table prefix for the SQL queries.  It will vary by
# database instance.  Uncomment only one value.

#db_user: CTDEV_USER
db_user: CTQA_USER
#db_user: CTOOLS_USER

########## These next 3 values are unlikely to change. #########
# Put in a line break for comma separated lists in IN clause every this many entries.
comma_break_rate: 5
# Maximum number of realms to add to each query (obsolete)
realms_max: 20
# Table used for logging actions taken.  Unlikely to change except when testing.

# Name of role / function archive table to be used for restoring

# indentify the correct one.  The table name format is
# 'sakai_realm_rl_fn_' with the date of table creation appended.  SQL
# to generate a date specific backup table is created automatically
# along with the read only sql.

###################### list of special sites to restore / exempt

# Sometimes sites need to be listed explicitly by site id.  The site lists
# always contain a dummy siteid so that there is at least one.  (See if you can
# guess which one it is.)

# While the sites are obtained from the yml file the lists of sites
# are maintained in csv files. Those files are read at when the
# generateBatchROSqlSite.pl script is run to create a one-time yml file
# for the actual sql script creation.  The yml format is illustrated below
# but the user doesn't need to explicitly add the lists to the yml file. 

# Sites on the restoreSites list will have their permissions restored
# from the archive table specified elsewhere.  Remove sites on the
# list after they are processed so that permissions aren't restored by
# accident in a future run.

# restoreSites:
#     - ImJustADummySiteIdStringHAHAYouCantFindMe

# Sites on the list of excluded sites will not be made read-only.  If there are
# multiple runs of the script verify that the right sites continue to
# be on the list.  Some administrative sites should always be listed.
# E.g. the gateway admin site.  The list must have at least one entry
# so a dummy site should be included.

# Sample excluded Sites entry.  The real site ids are read from the
# exemptsites.csv file
